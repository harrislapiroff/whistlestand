A Modular 3D Printable Whistle Stand
====================================

There's a lot to say about this whistle stand, but for generating STLs, the crucial knowledge is that it was designed using [OpenSCAD][] with the [BOSL2][] library. The versions which this has been confirmed compatible are:

* OpenSCAD 2023.10.09 (git f41aefc37)
* BOSL2 (git [910c3ea7c0e25048913992eca7dcd2f37087c02c][])

It may well render properly with other versions, but those are the ones I used.
